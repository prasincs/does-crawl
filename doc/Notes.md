# Notes

* Go Sublime is pretty sweet
* If you get stuck in commandline, press `Ctrl+b` and type `tskill` (Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21135110/how-to-exit-go-run-in-the-gosublimes-command-shell)
* Great Go resource http://www.edlin.org/software-development/go_language_golang_notes.html

## On generating documentations

* I did not realize the godoc.org service was open source, or was different than pydoc/javadoc.. sigh..
