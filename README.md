# Does Crawl 

_Because DO Crawl didn't sound quite right_

## How to Build and run

The build script included should handle the process.

`./build && ./bin/does-crawl` should work well.

It should start a web server in port 9999, but an optional `--port` parameter can be supplied that allows you to change the port number.

## Caveats

This is my first from-scratch-ish golang project built under heavy time constraints (and context-switching, writing Go and Clojure at the same time is not recommended). I'll probably hate the code in a few days/weeks/months once I understand more things about organizing go code.
