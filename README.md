# Does Crawl 

_Because DO Crawl didn't sound quite right_

## How to Build and run

The build script included should handle the process.

`./build && ./does-crawl` should work well.


## Caveats

This is my first from-scratch-ish golang project built under heavy time constraints. I'll probably hate the code in a few days/weeks/months once I understand more things about organizing go code.
